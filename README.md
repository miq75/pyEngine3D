PyEngine3D is a simple module using only the python standard library to display and interact with 3D designs.

---

The main module can be found in the "graphics" directory, the other files are demos of different features.

---

The first step is to create an Engine object which requires a set of points and a set of triangles linking them together.

```Python
test = Engine3D([[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2]], [[0, 1, 2]]) # this will create a single triangle between these points
test = Engine3D([[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2]], [[0, 1, 2, "green"]]) # you can also change the color of the triangle (the default is green)
```

You can also define a list of folds that would be used to animate a multi-step folding.
Each folding step is itself composed of simultaneously done line folds.
Each line fold is defined by it's angle in degreee, two vertices that defines an oriented axe and a list of concerned vertices.

```Python
vertices = [[-1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0], [1, -1, .5], [-1, -1, -.5]]
faces = [[0, 1, 2, "green"], [1, 2, 3, "red"]]
folds = [[(45, 1, 2, [3])]]
test = Engine3D(vertices, faces, folds)
```

From your code, you can modify the display using the writePoints, writeTriangles, rotate, free_rotate, part_free_rotate, clear and render methods.

```Python
test.writePoints([[3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2]]) # change the points
test.writeTriangles([[2, 1, 0, "blue"]]) # the order of the points does not matter
test.rotate("y", 45) # rotate the object 45 degrees around the y axis
test.free_rotate(45, 1, 2) # rotate the object 45 degrees around vertices[1]vertices[2] axis
test.part_free_rotate(45, 1, 2, [3, 4]) # rotate vertices[3] and vertices[4] 45 degrees around (vertices[1],vertices[2]) axis
test.clear() # clear the display
test.render() # update the image
```

You can also use the following keys to interact with the display.

1. Left mouse button + Drag -> Rotate the view
2. Up arrow -> Zoom in
3. Down arrow -> Zoom out
4. w, a, s, d -> Move the view up, left, down or right
5. n, p -> Animate the next or previous fold

The module now also allows you to move points on the model (this is still a work in progress)

1. Select a point using the right mouse button (holding)
2. Select an axis to move along by pressing x, y or z
3. Use the right and left arrow keys to move along the axis
